# AntiWDL

**AntiWDL** is a simple Bukkit plugin designed to detect and kick players who attempt to use the **LiteLoader-based World Downloader** [Plugin Channels (Wiki.vg, Wayback Machine)](https://web.archive.org/web/20241130182714/https://wiki.vg/Plugin_channels/World_downloader).

This plugin **only** blocks those specific plugin messages; it does **not** stop other mods or methods of downloading, including those that use proxies or alternate channels.
